## Description

This is our first Group Project for the University of Denver Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp! Our group for this project included Luke Oxner, Andrew Fiscus, Blair Taylor, and Brandon Fontes.<br>

The project involved building an entire web application from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In addition, we were required to utilize two server-side APIs to pull data, and client-side storage for storing persistent data. Additionally, we were required to use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap for styling the user interface. Outside of those requirements, we were given free reign over building our application - everything from functionality to design.

Our group's project is called "Turn That Frown Upside Down!". It's a site that is designed to brighten the user's day through jokes and GIFs. When the user first opens the site, they are greeted with two GIFs randomly selected from the top 20 trending GIFs on GIPHY. Below those GIFs, the user can pick one or more categories for a joke they'd like to receive. Once they click "Submit", they are presented with a joke fom one of their chosen categories (courtesy of "Jokes API V2"), along with a correlated GIF from GIPHY. The user can then click the "Home" button to repeat the process and generate another joke and GIF. Additionally, the user's previous jokes are stored in local storage, and will appear under in a list on the page each time they search for a new joke. If the list of old jokes gets too long, the user can simply click the "Reset Stored Jokes" button to clear their joke history.

## Development

Our group utilized git branching to work on this project simultaneously from different locations. We split our group into two sub-groups, with one developing the UI/design/HTML/CSS (Blair and Brandon), and the other writing the functionality/logic/Javascript/jQuery (Luke and Andrew). Overall this method seemed to be effective, and our group id a great job collaborating and working with one another to make this project come together.

## Deployment

The code (and associated assets) are hosted right here in this GitHub repository, and it's all live on the web thanks to GitHub pages. If you would like to check it out, you can view the site at the link below:
